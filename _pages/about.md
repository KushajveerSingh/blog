### Work Experience
- **Full Stack Developer** (Jul 2022 - current, UGA)
    - Worked in the IT department of the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of Georgia (Athens, GA, USA).
    - Migrated a legacy *Microsoft Access* database to *PostgreSQL* with 18 years of data in it.
    - In order to maintain the existing 217 legacy programs, wrote a parser in *Node.js* and *Express* which converts Access queries to PostgreSQL queries on the fly.
    - Created the development and production servers, which included doing IP whitelisting, backup configuration with a local storage server, periodically syncing development and production servers, and implementing the best Linux security practices.
    - To prevent people from accessing the SQL queries from outside, wrote a program in *Node.js* using which queries can be written in a text file, that is never shared with the public, and refer to them using a special function in *JavaScript*.
    - Automated the data entry pipeline for handwritten submission forms using *Python* and *JavaScript*, resulting in a reduction of time from 2 minutes per form to 25 seconds on average. This was done by adding autocomplete functionality for various fields of the form like name, address, contact info and merging that with the existing database interface. 
    - Used *Selenium* to automate browser-related tasks, like downloading an invoice from UPS and emailing it internally.
    - To send results to the client, a codebase built on top of a proprietary language created by the IT manager was being used which converts information from the database into a PDF. Rewrote that entire codebase using *React*, *TypeScript*, *Material-UI*, *Redux*. This included converting information from a 200-page manual to a React program and updating the queries from Access to PostgreSQL.
    - Agile development was used. Email and github issues were used to track and communicate daily status and a weekly retrospective meeting was conducted to review the successes of the week and areas of improvement from the previous week.

- **Graduate Teaching Assistant** (Jan 2022 - Aug 2022, UGA)
    - Worked in the Computer Science department, University of Georgia (Athens, GA, USA).
    - Led weekly meetings and facilitated group discussions for the course *Discrete Mathematics for CS*.
    - Held one-on-one office hours for 2 transfer students and went through the entire course content in detail, along with discussing practical applications of the course content.


### Additional Experience

    - Created a GlobalConsistency module that improves the robustness of graph neural networks against adversarial attacks
    - Proposed module beats state-of-the-art in 3 out of 4 datasets, while adding 4 lines of code
    - Presented a poster on generating full human body 3D scans from random noise

- **Workshop paper reviewer, CVPR 2021** (Apr 2021)
    - Reviewed 2 papers for the *Biometrics Workshop, jointly with the Workshop on Analysis and Modeling of Faces and Gestures, CVPR 2021*
    - Split the review into summary, strengths, weaknesses

- **Paper reviewer and presentation judge, GJSHS 2021** (Feb 2021 - Mar 2021)
    - Reviewed 6 papers for the 46th *Georgia Junior Science & Humanities Symposium (GJSHS)* from high-school students.
    - The review included detailed feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and suggestions for improvement based on the recent research in the field
    - Presentation judge for the final round of the competition.

- **Winner TechGig CodeGladiators hackathon** (May 2019 - July 2019)
    - Won the first sole place in TechGig CodeGladiators, in the Artificial Intelligence theme where 15 teams were selected from all across India from a pool of 0.5 million candidates.
    - Implemented a fully-deployable parking space detection system using *PyTorch* from video.
    - Detections from multiple frames can be combined and adjusted over time depending on where the cars are being parked.
    - Frame can be split into a 3x3 grid allowing to make finer and more robust predictions and the result is combined into a single frame.  

- **Third place at IndiaSkills Nationals** (Sep 2018 - Nov 2018)
    - Won third place at the North-Zone regional finals in *IT Software Solutions for Business* at IndiaSkills, representing my state Chandigarh (India)
    - Build a desktop application using *C#* and an android application using *Java*.
    - Both applications required a database setup using *MySQL* and *phpMyAdmin*.

- **8-bit computer at PEC IEEE showcase** (Feb 2017 - Apr 2017)
    - Created an 8-bit computer on breadboard using NAND chips.
    - Implemented Add, Subtract logic and 2 byte memory module using *Flip Flops*

* [Unsupervised Parking Lot Detection](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/Unsupervised-Parking-Lot-Detection)
  
    A complete approach to detect parking lot spaces from images and then tell which spaces are occupied or not. Here I do not use any dataset for training my model to detect parking spaces. My implementation can be divided into these three modules:
    - *Object Detection Module* :- Use COCO pretrained model, no need to do finetuning.
    - *Label Processing Module* :- As out model is not finetuned, there are some tricks that I add to overcome these limitations
    - *Classification Module* :- Use the processed labels/bounding_boxes to tell if that parking space is occupied or not.
* [SPADE by Nvidia](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/SPADE-PyTorch)
  
    Unofficial implementation of SPDAE for image-to-translation from segmentation maps to the colored pictures. Due to compute limit I test it out for a simplified model on Cityscapes dataset and get descent results after 80 epochs with batch_size=2.

* [Waste Seggregation using trashnet](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/projects/Waste_Seggregation_using_trashnet)

    Contains the code to train models for trashnet and then export them using ONNX. It was part of a bigger project where we ran these models on Rasberry Pi, which controlled wooden planks to classify the waste into different categories (code for rasberry pi not included here).

* [Unscramble game](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/deep_learning/tree/master/random/unscramble_android_game)
  
    Python script to solve the unscramble android game. You are given 5 random letters and you have to find 3-letter, 4-letter, 5-letter english words from these 5 random letters. It is a simple brute force method with a english dictionary lookup.

* [Random Duty List](https://github.com/KushajveerSingh/Random-Duty-List)
  
    A PHP and MySQL based work where the aim is to assign duties from a list to various stations and make sure the duties are not repeated and the repetition occurs only after the list is exhausted.


## Jupyter Notebooks
