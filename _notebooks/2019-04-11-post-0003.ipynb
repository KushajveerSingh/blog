    "Ideally, nothing is wrong with them. But to get the most benefit out of BN we have to use a large batch size. And when we have smaller batch sizes we prefer to use GN. (By smaller I mean 1–2 images/GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this so?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand it we have to see how BN works. To make things simple, consider we have only one-channel on which we want to apply BN and we have 2 images as our batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would compute the mean and variance using the 2 images and then normalize the one-channel of the 2 images. So we used 2 images to compute mean and variance. This is the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "By increasing batch size, we are able to sample the value of mean and variance from a larger population, which means that the computed mean and variance would be closer to their real values.\n",

    "## Weight Standardization\n",
    "Unlike BN and GN that we apply on activations i.e the output of the conv layer, we apply Weight Standardization on the weights of the conv layer itself. So we are applying WS to the kernels that our conv layer uses.\n",
    "\n",

    "But there are easier ways to understand it.\n",

    "First, consider the optimizer we use. The role of the optimizer is to optimize the weights of our model, but when we apply normalization layers like BN, we do not normalize our weights, but instead, we normalize the activations which are optimizer does not even care about.\n",

    "By using WS we are essentially normalizing the gradients during the backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the paper tested WS on various computer vision tasks and they were able to achieve better results with the combination of WS+GN and WS+BN. The tasks that they tested on included:\n",

    "From the above experiments, I think I would prefer not to use Weight Standardization when I am using cyclic learning. For large batch sizes, it even gave worse performance and for smaller batch sizes, it gave almost similar results, but using weight standardization we added a lot of time to our computation, which we could have used to train our model with Batch Norm alone.\n",

    "For constant learning rate, I think weight standardization still makes sense as there we do not change our learning rate in the training process, so we must benefit from the smoother loss function. But in the case of cyclic learning, it does not offer us a benefit."
