    "1. **Selecting categories**:- The 1000 categories were manually (based on heuristics related to WordNet hierarchy). Also, to include fine-grained classification in the dataset the authors included 120 categories of dog breeds (this is why ImageNet models generally dream about dogs). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting candidate images**:- Taken directly from ImageNet database. They basically did search queries for each category (synset) on several image search engines. The queries were also translated to Chinese, Spanish, Dutch and Italian to increase the diversity of the images."

The users were then asked to verify if the image contained the category. There was also a quality control system setup which you can read in the paper. "
