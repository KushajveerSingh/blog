title: "Data augmentation with Resizer network for Image Classification"
description: "A CNN model is used to learn data augmentation for image classification task. The generated image of the Resizer model is fed into a standard ResNet model for the downstream task. Model is tested on Imagenette and Imagewoof datasets with code to reproduce the experiments."
